# Welcome

HTML and CSS you’ve been learning so far are languages, a way for you to tell browser what you want it to do. With an intention of creating a blue button you write `<button style=“background-color: blue”>Confirm</button>` so browser understands your intentions, turns `<button>` into a clickable rectangle, fills it with color because it understands `background-color: blue`, and displays a word “Confirm” inside because you told it in a way browsers understand. 

HTML and CSS are markup languages, they are used to give instruction about content, position in space, the look and the very basic interactions of the elements. To make your prototypes truly interactive you need a scripting (programming) language — JavaScript.

JavaScript is a powerful language, and it allows you to create logic for almost everything on the web, from a small button in UI to a very complex server.

This means that you have to know, understand and be able to properly combine a decent set of rules and patterns to start speaking this language. 

Targeting this complexity is where frameworks come to play. Frameworks can be seen as interpreters. If you talk directly to browser in JavaScript and ask it to make a container clickable, you would have to take him through multiple steps to tell which button, what’s clickable, etc. If you use framework, you talk to it not to a browser and you would just say makebuttonclickable and the framework understands and gives all the instructions to browser. 

Vue is a framework you will use to prototype.
