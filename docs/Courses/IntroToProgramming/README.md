# Foreword

HTML and CSS are markup languages and they are used to give instructions about content, position in space, the look and the very basic interactions of the elements. To make your prototypes truly interactive you need a scripting (programming) language ‚Äî JavaScript.

JavaScript is a powerful language, and it allows you to create logic for almost everything on the web: from a small button in UI to a very complex server. And we all know that *with great power comes great responsibility* ü§üüï∏.

This means that you have to know, understand and be able to properly combine a decent set of rules and patterns to start speaking this language. 

Targeting this complexity is where frameworks come to play. Frameworks can be seen as interpreters. If you talk directly to browser in JavaScript and ask it to make a container clickable, you would have to take him through multiple steps to tell which button, what‚Äôs clickable, etc. If you use framework, you talk to it, not to a browser, and you just say ‚Äúmake button clickable‚Äù and the framework understands and gives all the instructions to browser.

Vue is a framework you will use to prototype.
