# Containers

since this covers html only and no css, I must warn you without css things are quite ugly

container is a pair of tags — an opening and closing one — and content in between. angle brackets

some tags don’t need a closing tag

containers have nested structure. Just like groups of layers, one folds into another one, and into another one and so on. There are terms to define this relations: **parent** container and **child** container. This definition is relative, a container can be a child container to a container it's placed within, and at the same time a parent container to the ones inside it.
