# Practice

## Task #1

## Task #2

Design a prototype with appropriate variables and events to allow users increase and decrease each value in a table and calculate the sum.

![Order demo](./media/order.gif)

1. Start from the blank prototyping [template](./../Setup/README.md).
2. Create a layout similar to the shown above but with your own styles.
3. Store all prices, quantities and a total as [variables](./../Data/variables.md#variables) and [display](./../Data/display.md#displaying-in-containers) them in the layout.
4. Create [click events](./click.md) for each '-', '+' and 'Calculate' buttons.
5. Make sure that your total is a sum of all prices, each multiplied by the corresponding quantity. You'll need to [group](./arithmetics.md#groupping) your operations to achieve that.
