## Prerequisites / Requirements

This course doesn't require any prior knowledge of JavaScript or any other programming languages.

If you have experience with programming, some concepts may be familiar to you and you may move at a faster pace. Yet we recommend to go through all articles to understand the mockupless approach to those concepts, which often differs from the way programming is usually tought.
<!-- todo: a link to About section where approach is described and reasoning is provided -->

This is a complete list of things you need to start with the course:

- Understanding [Layout basics](./../LayoutBasics/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor

You can use Firefox as your browser and any code editor of your choice for this course. Yet Chrome and VSCode are used in all examples and demos, so by using them you lower the risk of spending time looking for some functionality in a different piece of software.

## What you'll learn

This course teaches you the very basic concepts of creating prototypes with JavaScript and Vue. 

- **Store data, change it and display in UI**. This will give you the ability to change content when interacting with a prototype.
- **Save users' input**. This will allow you to use it in different parts of you prototype and modify your UI based on user's input.
- **Show and hide containers**. This gives an ability to display elements, components and view conditionally.
- **React to clicks** and other users' interactions.
- **Display lists and grids** without creating containers for each item.

In the end of the course you will create a multi-screen prototype for ...

## Practice

Almost every article in the course has self-practice tasks that are designed to help you understand the material by trying to apply the knowledge yourself. Completing these tasks is *highly recommended* as it is almost impossible to understand most of the concepts without attempting to use them and to combine one with another, facing problems and finding your way out.

<!--

HTML and CSS are markup languages and they are used to give instructions about content, position in space, the look and the very basic interactions of the elements. To make your prototypes truly interactive you need a scripting (programming) language — JavaScript.

JavaScript is a powerful language, and it allows you to create logic for almost everything on the web: from a small button in UI to a very complex server. And we all know that *with great power comes great responsibility* 🤟🕸.

This means that you have to know, understand and be able to properly combine a decent set of rules and patterns to start speaking this language. 

Targeting this complexity is where frameworks come to play. Frameworks can be seen as interpreters. If you talk directly to browser in JavaScript and ask it to make a container clickable, you would have to take him through multiple steps to tell which button, what’s clickable, etc. If you use framework, you talk to it, not to a browser, and you just say “make button clickable” and the framework understands and gives all the instructions to browser. 

Vue is a framework you will use to prototype.
