# About the course

<!-- a very brief yet clear description of what the course provides, how it's different from usual intro to programming course why it's important -->

## Prerequisites / Requirements

This course doesn't require any prior knowledge of JavaScript or any other programming languages.

If you have experience with programming, some concepts may be familiar to you and you may move at a faster pace, though it's recommended to go through all artciles to understand the mockupless approach to those concepts, which often differs from the way programming is tought originally <!-- a link to About section where approach is described and reasoning is provided -->

This is a complete list of things you need to start with the course:

- Understanding of [Layout basics](./../LayoutBasics/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor

You can use Firefox as your browser and any code editor of your choice for this course. Yet, Chrome and VSCode are used in all examples and demostrations, so by using them you lower the risk of spending time looking for some functionality in a different piece of software.

## What you'll learn

Through this course you will learn basic concepts of embracing the power of programming prototypes with the help of Vue.

- Store data, change it and display in UI
- Save users' input
- Show and hide containers (elements, components, views)
- React to clicks and other users' interactions with UI
- Display lists and grids without creating containers for each item

In the end of the course you will create a multi-screen prototype for ... <!-- (hotel || plane tickets booking process) || online store checkout -->

## Practice

Almost every article in the course has self-practice tasks that are designed to help you understand the material by trying to apply the knowledge yourself. Completing these tasks is *highly recommended* as it is probably impossible to understand most of the concepts without attempting to use them and to combine one with another, facing problems and finding your way out.

## Community

Mockupless comes with an open community of designers who share your path, your struggles and your desire to create better products. Join [General Flarum]() to discuss core concepts and [Interaction Flarum]() to ask question about the course, provide help to others and share your progress.

<!--

HTML and CSS are markup languages and they are used to give instructions about content, position in space, the look and the very basic interactions of the elements. To make your prototypes truly interactive you need a scripting (programming) language — JavaScript.

JavaScript is a powerful language, and it allows you to create logic for almost everything on the web: from a small button in UI to a very complex server. And we all know that *with great power comes great responsibility* 🤟🕸.

This means that you have to know, understand and be able to properly combine a decent set of rules and patterns to start speaking this language. 

Targeting this complexity is where frameworks come to play. Frameworks can be seen as interpreters. If you talk directly to browser in JavaScript and ask it to make a container clickable, you would have to take him through multiple steps to tell which button, what’s clickable, etc. If you use framework, you talk to it, not to a browser, and you just say “make button clickable” and the framework understands and gives all the instructions to browser. 

Vue is a framework you will use to prototype.
